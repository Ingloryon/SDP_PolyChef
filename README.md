## Pitch:
We are developing an application for all the people that like to cook. The goal is to have an easy way to share your incredible recipe ideas with your friends and followers through a social network app based on the recipe that you publish. 
You can give feedback to the creator of recipes you have tried by either letting a comment or rating the recipes. Rating will help the best cook and recipes creator get reward (internet points) and more visibility so that it is easier to find good recipes that other people have tried. 
When you cook, your hands are not always clean enough to check the recipe on your phone so the app will also integrate vocal command so that you can get the information you need by asking the app.

## Main caracteritics and features of PolyChef:

- The app has been built using Android Studio using compileSdkVersion 29 (minimum minSdkVersion is 24) and java sourceCompatibility 1.8
