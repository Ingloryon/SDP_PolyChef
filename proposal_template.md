# SDP Proposal - Team \12

## Team / App name:
PolyChef

## Description:
The purpose of this app is to share recipes with everybody on the campus. A user could add, search for and comment some recipes. 

## Requirements:
### Split app model: 
All the recipes will be stored on the cloud with all their comments and will be accessible by all users.

### Sensor usage:
The user could scan a recipe in a cookbook to add it in the database. A user could also take pictures of the dish once it is cooked to show the result.

### User support:
The users could "like" the recipes of other chefs. Those "likes" could give points to the chef, that would give him "stars" or new looks for his "avatar". Users could also "follow" other users to be notify each time this user posts something.

### Local cache:
A user could "pin" his favorites recipes. Those recipes will then be stored locally. Also, all the latest recipes the user looked at could be stored in the local cache.  

### Offline mode:
First, there will be a homepage showing some basic recipes for users who were never connected before. A user that was previously connected could also see the recipes that he "pinned".
